Hii everyone, this is just a minimalist project I created to just timepass, this small script reads strings from a txt files and generates some good report
Key features are:
  counts number of words in file
  counts how many times a letter is appeared in the whole text.
  counts how many times all the charactes appeared in the whole text.

Feel free to use it if you think it's usefull or even if you want to just look at the code or want to play around feel free to do so.
